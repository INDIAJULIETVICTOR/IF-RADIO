## Features

- Real-time frequency display.
- Controls for RF Gain, Squelch, and other radio functions.
- Clear and intuitive graphical user interface built with Tkinter.
- Visual indicators such as signal level (S-meter).

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Tkinter (included in Python for most distributions)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ifradio.git
   cd ifradio
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   (If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, you can add Tkinter directly to the installation instructions.)

## Usage

To start the radio front panel, run the following command:

```bash
python ifradio.py
```

The user interface will open, displaying the main radio controls such as RF Gain, Squelch, signal display, and more.
